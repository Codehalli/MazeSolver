Purpose for this program was to create a maze solver. The maze solver will be provided with multiple different mazes, which are created/borders of asterisk(*).  The maze will be stored essentially in a 2 -dimensional array. The path opening will be either be in column or rows.

Key Concepts in this program was to use the depth-first search algorithm, with will essentially look at the boundraies all around its self in advance and based on the right location it will move forward. Some other concepts also visited in this program is dynamically allocating variables. It will also take account of how the maze was solved and then diplay the run-time error and path visibiity.
